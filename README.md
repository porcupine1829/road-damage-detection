# Road Damage Detection

A deep learning model based on YOLOv8 for detecting road damages, including potholes and other surface defects.

## Overview

This project implements a road damage detection system using YOLOv8 to identify and classify various types of road damages. It uses the Road Damage Detection Dataset (RDD2022) to train models that can detect four classes of road damage:

- D00: Longitudinal cracks
- D10: Transverse cracks
- D20: Alligator cracks
- D40: Potholes

## Dataset

The project uses the Road Damage Detection Dataset 2022 (RDD2022), which contains images of road damages from multiple countries. The dataset preparation script combines data from all countries and splits it into training and test sets.
